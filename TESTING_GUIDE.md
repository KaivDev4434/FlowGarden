# 🧪 FlowGarden Quick Testing Guide

## ⚡ Testing Mode Enabled!

I've temporarily modified the app for **super fast testing**:
- **Focus Timer**: 10 seconds (instead of 25 minutes)
- **Plant Withering**: 2 minutes (instead of 24 hours)
- **Care Reminders**: 1 minute (instead of 20 hours)

## 🚀 Quick Test Scenarios

### 1. **Basic Plant Creation & Focus** (2 minutes)
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Click "Plant Your First Seed"
3. Enter a project name (e.g., "Test Project")

5. Click "Plant Seed"
6. Click "Start Focus" on your new plant
7. Click "Start" and wait **10 seconds**
8. Watch the completion animation and sounds! 🎉

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Plant health increases
- ✅ Sparkle celebration animation
- ✅ Growth sound effects
- ✅ Analytics update

### 2. **Test All Plant Types** (5 minutes)
Create plants with different types to see unique animations:
- 🌵 **Succulent** (green, hardy look)
- 🌲 **Bonsai** (tree-like, elegant)

### 3. **Plant Care System** (3 minutes)
1. Create a plant
2. Wait **2 minutes** without doing anything
3. Lower the plant's health by clicking the plant several times
4. Watch for the **withering animation** and **care reminder popup**
5. Click "Water" button to restore health
6. See the growth celebration! 💧

### 4. **Sound System** (1 minute)
1. Start a focus session
2. Toggle the **sound button** (🔊/🔇)
3. Click the **forest button** (🌲) for ambient sounds
4. Complete the session to hear celebration sounds

### 5. **Analytics Dashboard** (2 minutes)
1. Complete a few 10-second focus sessions
2. Click the **Analytics button** (📊) in the top right
3. Check your productivity score and stats
4. View recent sessions and plant health overview

### 6. **Advanced Animations** (3 minutes)
1. Watch plants with **low health** (red, withering animation)
2. **Boost health** to see sparkle celebrations
3. Check **plant status indicators** (💚 for healthy, 💧 for withering)
4. Notice **Framer Motion** hover effects on cards

## 🎯 What to Look For

### ✅ **Animations Working:**
- Plant growth stages (seed → sprout → young → mature → blooming)
- Sparkle celebrations when health increases
- Withering effects for neglected plants
- Smooth UI transitions and hover effects

### ✅ **Sounds Working:**

- Water button restores health
- Different urgency levels (attention → urgent → critical)

### ✅ **Data Persistence:**
- Plants saved between page refreshes
- Session history tracked
- Analytics update in real-time
- Settings preserved

## 🔧 Advanced Testing

### **Test Plant Health Decay**
1. Create a plant
2. Wait 3+ minutes without focusing
3. Watch health drop and withering animation start
4. See care reminder notification popup

### **Test Focus Streaks**
1. Complete multiple 10-second sessions
2. Check analytics for streak counting
3. Try different plant types in one session

### **Test Edge Cases**
1. Create plant with empty name (should fail gracefully)
2. Try starting multiple focus sessions
3. Test with sounds disabled
4. Test plant deletion

## ⚠️ **Remember: This is Testing Mode!**

When ready for production:
1. Change timer back to `25 * 60` seconds (25 minutes)
2. Change withering back to `24` hours
3. Change care reminders back to `20` hours

- ✅ All 5 plant types and their animations
- ✅ Sound system and ambient audio
- ✅ Plant care and withering system
- ✅ Analytics and productivity tracking
- ✅ All UI animations and interactions
